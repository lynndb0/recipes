Ingrediants

 2 tablespoons maple syrup 
 1 tablespoon wholegrain mustard 
 2 teaspoons soy sauce 
 2 teaspoons brown sugar 
 4 (about 120g each) salmon fillets 
 400g can lentils, rinsed, drained 
 250g cooked beetroot, cut into wedges 
 120g pkt Coles Brand Australian 4 Leaf Salad 
 1/3 cup (35g) hazelnuts, toasted, coarsely chopped 
 100g marinated fetta, crumbled, marinade reserved 
 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 

Step 1 
Combine the maple syrup, mustard, soy sauce and sugar in a shallow container. Add salmon and turn to coat. Place in the fridge for 10 mins to develop the flavours.

Step 2 
Preheat grill on high. Line a baking tray with foil. Place the salmon on the lined tray. Cook under grill for 3 mins or until salmon caramelises. Turn and cook for a further 2 mins for medium or until cooked to your liking. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil. Set aside for 5 mins to rest.

Step 3 
Meanwhile, combine the lentils, beetroot, salad leaves, hazelnuts and fetta in a large bowl. Combine the vinegar and 2 tbs of the reserved fetta marinade in a small bowl. Season. Drizzle over the salad and combine.

Step 4 
Divide among serving plates. Top with salmon and serve immediately.
